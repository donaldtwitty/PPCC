                        <h4>Nursery Minsitry</h4>
                        <p>At Perpetual Praise, we understand the importance of providing a safe, nurturing, and
                            spiritually enriching environment for your children. Our team of dedicated and trained
                            volunteers, alongside experienced staff members, are fully prepared to care for your
                            precious little ones. We offer specialized care for various age groups, ensuring that each
                            child receives age-appropriate attention and activities designed to foster their growth and
                            development.
                            <br><br><em>6 weeks - 9 months Weeblers:</em>
                            Our Weeblers program is tailored for our youngest members, providing a warm and caring
                            environment where infants can thrive. We focus on creating a peaceful and loving space where
                            your baby can feel secure and loved, with gentle interactions and attentive care from our
                            trained volunteers.
                            <br><br><em>10 - 23 months Wobblers:</em> As your child begins to explore their world more
                            actively, our Wobblers program supports their curiosity and early developmental milestones.
                            Our caregivers engage with children through interactive play, simple stories, and songs,
                            helping them develop motor skills and early social interactions in a safe and joyful
                            setting.
                            <br><br><em>24 - 35 months Toddlers:</em> The Toddlers program is designed to cater to the
                            energetic and inquisitive nature of toddlers. We offer structured activities that encourage
                            exploration, creativity, and learning through play. Our team provides a balanced mix of
                            guided play, storytelling, and group activities that promote social skills, sharing, and
                            early cognitive development.
                            <br><br><em>Special Needs Ministry:</em> We believe that every child is a precious gift, and
                            our Special Needs Ministry is dedicated to providing personalized care and support for
                            children with unique challenges. Our trained volunteers and staff work closely with families
                            to create a tailored experience that meets each child's individual needs. We offer a
                            loving, inclusive environment where children of all abilities can participate in church
                            activities, learn about God's love, and connect with others.

                        <h4>Weekly Small Group Study</h4>
                        <p>We believe that spiritual growth is most effective within a close-knit community. Our Weekly
                            Small Group Study provides an opportunity for you to dive deeper into your faith, build
                            meaningful relationships, and explore the teachings of the Bible in an intimate and

                            <br><br>Each week, small groups gather to study scripture, discuss its application to daily
                            life,
                            and encourage one another in their walk with Christ. These groups are designed to foster
                            genuine connections, where everyone can share their thoughts, ask questions, and grow
                            together in a safe and welcoming space.
                            <br><br>Whether you are new to the faith, seeking answers, or looking to strengthen your
                            relationship with God, our small groups offer a place to belong. With groups meeting at
                            various times and locations, there’s sure to be one that fits your schedule and life stage.
                            <br><br>Join a Weekly Small Group Study and experience the joy of learning and growing
                            alongside
                            fellow believers. Together, we’ll navigate life's challenges, celebrate victories, and
                            deepen our understanding of God’s Word. This is more than just a study—a journey of faith
                            shared with friends.

                            programs, or providing care to those in need, our outreach teams actively transform lives
                            right here at home. We partner with local organizations and ministries to address the unique
                            needs of our community, building relationships and sharing God’s love through tangible acts

                        <h4>Grade School</h4>
                        <p><br><br><strong>Elementary Ministry (Kindergarten - 5th Grade)</strong>
                            <br>Our Elementary Ministry provides a fun, engaging, and spiritually enriching environment for
                            kindergarten through 5th-grade children. We believe that these formative years are crucial
                            for laying a solid foundation of faith, and we are committed to helping your child grow in
                            their knowledge and love of Jesus.
                            <br><br><em>Biblical Teaching</em>
                            <br>Through age-appropriate Bible lessons, interactive storytelling, and creative activities, we
                            introduce children to the foundational truths of the Christian faith. Our curriculum is
                            designed to help them understand who God is, how much He loves them, and how they can live
                            out their faith daily. We make learning about the Bible exciting and relatable, encouraging
                            kids to explore Scripture and apply its teachings to their lives.
                            <br><br><strong>Middle School Ministry (6th - 8th Grades)</strong>
                            <br>Our Middle School Ministry is designed to support students in grades 6-8 as they navigate
                            the exciting yet sometimes challenging preteen years. We create a safe, welcoming space
                            where middle schoolers can explore their faith, build meaningful friendships, and develop a
                            strong identity in Christ.
                            <br><br><em>Biblical Foundations</em>
                            <br>We understand that middle school is a time of questioning and exploration, so our teaching
                            focuses on helping students understand and apply biblical truths to their lives. Through
                            engaging lessons, group discussions, and hands-on activities, we guide them in discovering
                            what it means to follow Jesus, make wise choices, and grow in their relationship with God.
                            <br><br><strong>High School Ministry (9th - 12th Grades)</strong>
                            <br>Our High School Ministry is focused on equipping students in grades 9-12 to own their faith
                            and live it boldly in their everyday lives. We recognize the importance of these years as
                            students prepare for adulthood, and we are committed to helping them develop a deep,
                            personal relationship with Jesus.
                            <br><br><em>Biblical Discipleship</em>
                            <br>Our teaching centers on helping high school students understand the depth of God’s Word and
                            how it applies to their lives. We tackle relevant topics and real-life issues, providing
                            biblical insights and practical advice that empower students to make godly decisions, stand
                            firm in their faith, and positively influence their schools and communities.
